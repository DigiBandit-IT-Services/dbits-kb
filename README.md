# Employee Guide

Welcome to hell... If you are in our server room that is, as we name all our servers after the greek gods of the underworld (and demi gods for VMs), if that made no sense to you, it's ok. We'll go over it at some point.

  

OK, enough blabbering! Onto the guide of the employee (that's you)!

  

Welcome to DigiBandit IT Services, or whatever dalton is calling it at this moment in time... This guide is a collection of notes and knowledge from Dalton, Ethan, Amanda, Tara and probably 10 students.

  

Above, you'll see cool links to further details, click them and read them, and when you are finished, you'll find that you can now magically recall tidbits of information about things like your job and what it is you suppose to be doing. If you suddenly feel you have knowledge beyond that shortlist, please see a physician, as you may have accidentally (forgot you) ingested hallucinogens!

# Open & Close

**OPEN & CLOSE PROCEDURES**  
_Procedures to follow when opening and closing the shop. Follow these steps if you are the first or last person out._

# Opening Procedure

**Clock-in**

The first thing you should do when entering the shop is to log into your user account on your workstation ([https://forms.gle/KMRewo2F2tSwLgHX8](https://forms.gle/KMRewo2F2tSwLgHX8)), then open up Syncro on the web browser.

  

Once on Syncro, click on the account name drop-down near the top right next to "Help," and select "Time Clock." A little window will pop up; enter your name in the note section to confirm who is clocking in, and then select "Clock In."

  

**Prep Cash Drawer/ Register**
------------------------------

Next, open up the "POS" section on Syncro (if you do not see this, try clicking on the "More" drop-down, it is usually the second option from the bottom above "Admin"). If the register is not already open, it should automatically bring you to the register opening page, where you will need to enter the amount of each coin/bill the register currently has. Once you enter the amount of each coin/bill, click on "Open Register" to open the register.

  

The register should always have a total of $150 in it. If there is over $150 total, take the excess and put it underneath the register tray. If there is less than $150 total, look under the register tray first for any cash that could be added, and if there is none, inform Dalton of what coins/bills are missing.

  

**Open Blinds**
---------------

Next, open up each blind to its marked height on the left side of the window sill.

  

**Open Signs**
--------------

All lights and open/closed signs should automatically be turned on at noon. At this time, ensure that both the open/closed signs in the window and near the door are on and correctly displaying "Open."

  

**Inventory**
-------------

If any items near the front desk need to be added to stock or placed up front, try to add them before customers come in.

# Closing Procedure

**Blinds**
----------

At 5 pm, the overhead lights, open/closed signs, and other switches should automatically turn off. At this time, close all the blinds.

  

**Open/Closed Sign**
--------------------

Along with the lights, the open/closed signs should also automatically change to "Closed." Please make sure both the sign in the windows and next to the door are correctly displaying that we are closed.

  

**Cash Drawer/ Register**
-------------------------

Open up the "POS" section again. This time, select the blue-highlighted "(close)" next to the "Status: Open" text on the right-hand side of the page. This will show you the same page as when you first opened to register, but this time if there were any sales throughout the day, some additional sections like Square or E-Transfer might appear. For these new sections, please enter the amount that it shows you. For the cash, enter the expected amount (if customers paid in cash, the expected amount would be over $150). Once you enter all the expected amounts, you can click on "Close Register," Then, on the following page, click "Done," and the register is closed.

  

After the register has been closed, don't forget to put any excess cash under the register tray, and if any cash is missing, add more to it or let Dalton know some coins/bills are missing.

  

**Cleaning**
------------

Clean the shop before you leave.

1.  1.  Sweep the floor.
    2.  Mop the floor if it looks filthy.
    3.  Prep the garbage bags and take them out after you lock up.
    4.  If you are done working on a customer device, put it back in a holding cubby and update their ticket so people know where to find it if needed.
    5.  Wipe down the display cabinets, monitors, products, and windows if they look dirty.

  

**Clock Out**
-------------

Go back to "Time Clock" located in the account name drop-down (same place where you clocked in), enter your name in the note section to confirm who is clocking out, and select "Clock Out."

After clocking out, lock the workstation by holding the Windows key + L on the keyboard.

  

**Lock Up**
-----------

Before you leave, make sure all the lights are off. They should automatically turn off at 5:15 pm, but if they are not, say aloud, "OK, Google, power down." All the lights should turn off.

  

Ensure any garbage bag is outside the shop, ready to be taken to the dumpster.

  

Make sure the door is fully closed, then tap once on the security pad screen on the wall. Then tap the red "Armed away" button. This will then start a 60-second timer for you to lock up (it is safe to open the door while the countdown is happening, you can't start it while the door is open). While the countdown is happening, use your key to lock the door and push on it to ensure it is locked. Once the timer hits 0, you should be able to see the red light on the security pad through the glass door to confirm that the alarm is armed.

  

If you are locking up on Saturdays, don't forget to use your building key to lock up the double doors on your way out.

# Unexpected Closure

When the store has to get closed unexpectedly (ex: snow storm, people out sick, etc.), you will need to set the store hours to "closed" for the day on Google.

  

To do this, start by signing in to Google chrome with your DigiBandit account ([\----@digibandit.ca](mailto:----@digibandit.ca)).

  

Once signed in, type "DigiBandit IT Services" in the Google search bar to get to our Google business page. If you are signed into your DigiBandit Google account, you should see the words "Your business on Google," indicating that you can manage the Google page.

  

You will then want to click the "Edit profile" button near the top left and select the "Hours" section. ![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/8e571725-6a74-4650-bd93-e43cea655290/image.png)

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/70fb19c5-e6ab-4a78-8b9e-be55ab2962fb/image.png)

Once on the "Hours" section, hover over "Holiday Hours" and click on it once it gets highlighted. This will allow you to edit the days the business is closed. Scroll down until you see the "Add a date" button, and click on it.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/5dcaa013-3837-48bd-8f40-7dcc06bfdaa3/image.png)

Finally, select the date the business will be closed, check the "Closed" checkbox, and click on "Save" to update the hours.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/a5b743c4-4d05-4cdf-b229-e02bc6487f0d/image.png)

You have now successfully updated the business hours.

**Unexpected Closure (Change Open/Closed Sign Remotely)**

Along with changing the store hours on Google, you will need to change the Open/Closed sign in the window next to our door.

  

Head to [https://signs.digibandit.com/signIn](https://signs.digibandit.com/signIn) and sign in using your account.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/273d7008-dcd7-4393-bac0-cd263eb799cb/image.png)

Once signed in, head over to "Schedules", then find the date that you are closing on and click on the blue section of it. The blue section indicates at what time of day the Open/Closed sign displays that we are "Open" and we want to change that so it says that we are closed. For this example, I've chosen Saturday, February 4th.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/31126697-d55e-438f-8f5f-c6f8f0cf051d/image.png)

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/5b90083f-175b-4d15-9731-06a31471242a/image.png)

Once you click on the blue section, you should see a new pop-up. Click on the "Change" button located next to the "Selected Asset" section.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/5cf7997f-cfec-4a3b-95ad-bf503b2517a1/image.png)

You will then be shown another pop-up with some icons that look like folders. you will want to select the following order:

*   DigiBandit
*   OpenClosed
*   Standard

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/f297e31e-b0c2-461b-ab42-cea31f87dc25/image.png)

You will then select the "closed-special.png" file.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/41056816-1b01-4eeb-9036-4d4c6a9c81ba/image.png)

Once saved, it should display this on the screen of the open/closed sign

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/59c21bac-bee2-4a33-bbe7-4aacdd64c850/image.png)

Once you select the .png file, you should be brought back to the screen you first saw when you clicked on the blue section of the calendar date. You will then want to make sure you set the "Repeat" option to "Does not repeat", and double-check that the date is correct. Once that is done, you can click on "Save"

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/16ee278b-cf6e-4813-8f04-72330cb5d977/image.png)

After you click on "Save" you will get one final pop-up asking if you want to apply the changes on this single item or on all items. Select "Single" and you are done.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/7d4a4236-e41a-467b-81cb-243c6e7f8659/image.png)

You have now successfully changed to the Open/Closed sign display for an unexpected closure.

# Product Markup Guide

Example:  
We purchased a USB stick from LongTech for $2.00; tax is 15% ($0.30), and shipping is $1.00, with a final total of $3.30  
  
Our markup for a USB stick (Accessory) is 30%, so $3.30 + 30% ($0.99), so the total would be $4.29

  

Note Regarding Shipping Costs:  
The best way (so far) to deal with shipping prices is to determine the average shipping cost divided among the items on order.  
  
Example:  
The USB stick from above was on order with ten items; shipping was $10, so $10 /10 = $1.00/shipping/item.

**Returns & Refunds**
=====================

We strive to provide high-quality services & products to our customers. We offer a one-year warranty on our services and labour, which covers any issues related to the repair work performed by our technicians. However, we do not offer refunds for any services that have been rendered. If you are unsatisfied with the quality of our work, please contact us and we will do our best to resolve the issue to your satisfaction

**Exceptions**
--------------

Unopened & unused products can be returned for store credit.

# Sticker on Products

If you ever see a little colored sticker stuck on a product, this just means that we received a new shipment for the same item but at a different price. The sticker on the item just means you should use the price that is listed on the physical item's price tag, and to not use the current price listed in Syncro (you can manually edit the price of an item in an invoice, just change it to whatever the price tag on the physical item says)

# Lights



# Data Recovery

Data recovery tickets require a deposit of $250 (taxes included) to be paid upfront before anything is done. They must also sign their name at the bottom of every page on the data recovery agreement. If we are running low on agreements, either ask Dalton to print out some more when possible or download the agreement by looking up "data recovery agreement" in google and getting it from the google doc (until the agreement is available to be signed digitally, then there will be no need to print it out). Customers can also optionally sign this agreement digitally by downloading the PDF from our website, then emailing it back to us through their ticket replies back at home.

  

Once the data recovery agreement is signed, you can put it on Tara's desk for processing.

  

The $250 deposit allows us to send out the drive to Recovery Force if needed without having to collect another deposit before doing so. Then, all they would have to pay extra would be Recovery Force's recovery fee depending on if it's a minor recovery ($500), or a major recovery ($1,2500). This fee is only paid if Recovery Force deems their drive recoverable or not.

# Digital Media - Onboarding Timeline

Here's a checklist for a social media manager to onboard a new client and get access to their social media accounts:

  

**Step 1: Get to Know the Client and Their Business**

*   Schedule an initial call or meeting with the client to discuss their business, target audience, and their goals for social media.
*   Gather information about their brand identity, messaging, and tone of voice to ensure consistency across social media channels.
*   Review their existing social media profiles and content, and identify areas for improvement.

  

**Step 2: Determine Which Social Media Channels to Use**

*   Identify the most relevant social media channels for the client's business and target audience.
*   Determine whether the client already has existing social media profiles, and if not, help them create new profiles.

  

**Step 3: Gain Access to the Client's Social Media Accounts**

*   Obtain login information for the client's existing social media accounts.
*   If clients have no social media accounts, help them create new ones.
*   Ensure the necessary access permissions are granted so the social media manager can post content, view analytics, and respond to comments and messages.

  

**Step 4: Develop a Content Strategy**

*   Develop a content strategy that aligns with the client's goals, target audience, and brand identity.
*   Create a content calendar that outlines what type of content will be posted on which days and when the content will be posted.
*   Create or curate visually appealing content that is engaging and relevant to the target audience.

  

**Step 5: Post Content and Engage with the Audience**

*   Post content regularly according to the content calendar.
*   Monitor social media channels for comments, messages, and mentions, and respond promptly and professionally.
*   Analyze social media content performance, and adjust the content strategy as needed.

  

**Step 6: Measure and Report on Results**

*   Set up analytics tracking to measure the performance of social media channels.
*   Report regularly on social media performance, including engagement rates, reach, and follower growth.
*   Use the data to make informed decisions about future content strategy and tactics.

  

By following these steps, a social media manager can onboard a new client and gain access to their social media accounts, develop a content strategy, and engage with the audience to achieve their social media goals.

Ticket invoices usually include a mix of labour and product line items.

  

These are typically generated from a ticket or estimate and are directly linked to the request that the ticket contains.

# HelpDesk for Home (Admin Guide)

**HelpDesk for Home by DigiBandit**

HelpDesk for Home by DigiBandit is our support software offering for residential clients.

  

HelpDesk for Home is a monthly subscription; for details on creating a recurring invoice for this, please visit the recurring invoices section.

  

For more information, please view the “Support” section on [digibandit.com](http://digibandit.com/)/support

  

Some of the benefits of our support software include the following:

*   Keeps your device and applications up to date automatically
*   Protects your device from viruses and malware with our antivirus
*   It enables you to request support or chat with DigiBandit at any time for any quick question
*   Alerts DigiBandit of any system issues or problems with your device
*   Enables you to request remote assistance to get help whenever you need it ($30/hour unless quick fix, some issues might need to be booked ahead of time)
*   Endpoint Detection and Response
*   Every ticket created that month for the device that has HelpDesk will not have to pay the standard $90 + tax deposit, instead, the customer will just be charged the $30 hourly rate
*   Includes a free deep clean if they have been subscribed to HelpDesk for a year (yearly cleaning)
*   If the customer opts for the “dataBack” add-on (additional $9.98/month), we can create cloud-based backups of their system and store them for the month (512GB included, additional $0.01/GB)

  

Once the customer pays for at least a month of HelpDesk for Home, head over to their customer profile. Once there, click on “+New” and select the bottom-most “Recurring invoice’ option.

  

Make the template name “HP - Customer Name” (where Customer Name is the name of the customer), and copy and paste this in the box directly to the right (Name of invoices that are generated).

  

Select “Monthly” in “Frequency”, then in “Run next at” select either the 15th or the last day of the month depending on which date you are closer to (if you are closer to the end of the month, check the “last day of the calendar month” box in addition to selecting the last day of the month on the little calendar).

  

“Period Mode” is always in advance inclusive.

  

On the right-hand side of the page, leave the text boxes empty, but check the “Email customer the PDF” box, the “Email customer the payment receipt” box, and the “Keep prices in sync with products if they change” box.

  

Scroll down and click the “Create a ticket 1 month before new invoice” box along with the “Automatically apply any customer credit” box. Then click on “Create Schedule”.

  

After you have created to schedule, at the bottom of the page add “Asset/RMM counter” as the recurring type, in the “Add line item” section, then add HelpDesk for Home. If they opted for the dataBack add-on, don’t forget to also add it as a line item. Since these are paid monthly you do not have to change the quantity or anything else unless they want to pay for multiple months at once, then simply change the quantity of these items to however many months they want.

  

The recurring invoice will now run monthly starting at the indicated “run next at” date near the top of the page. If the customer decides to pay for multiple months in bulk, then you can just make the “run next at” date correspond to how many months they paid for upfront.

  

If a customer is late in paying for the month, you can either send them an email through the ticket to should be created for the renewal, send a radio message to their asset, or give them a call.

  

* * *

M23 - RES Setup

When creating a recurring invoice for HelpDesk for home subscriptions, you will want to follow these steps:

  

1.  The template name and the name of the invoices that are generated are both the same. The format is "HD - Customer Full Name" where "customer full name" is the customer's full name (crazy, I know).

  

1.  The frequency is by default monthly since on our website it lists it as $14.98 + tax a month, but if a customer would like to pay in advance for say, a year, then you can change that to yearly, just make sure to adjust the quantity in the line item section we will get to later on.

  

1.  "Invoice Billing Terms" should be NET7 if it isn't that by default.

  

1.  "Run Next At" should be the 15th of the month. For residential HelpDesk users, we are billing them on the 15th of every month to differentiate them from MITS clients. Period mode is also "In Arrears (billing period ends the day of invoice creation)".

  

1.  The area on the right side with all the checkboxes will for the most part remain untouched, with the exception of "Email customer the PDF", "Email customer payment receipts", and "Keep prices in sync with products if they change". Check all those 3 boxes and move on to the next step.

  

1.  In the "Billing" section, check all the boxes. Specifically meaning check the "Automatically Apply any Customer Credit", "Auto charge payment profile on file", "Charge payment on the Invoice's due date rather than on its creation date", and "Retry the payment later if the billing fails" boxes. If you do not see some of these boxes, it might be because there is no saved payment option tied to the customer profile. You will also want to select the payment profile to use for the automatic billing in the "Payment profile to use" box (typically a credit card that you would save from the customer).

  

1.  ignore "Subscription Related" as these are for custom pricing plans mainly used for MITS clients.

  

1.  In "Add Line Item", the recurring type will be "Policy Folder" and the name of the product is "HelpDesk for Home".

  

1.  For the policy folder, for residential clients, you will select the "M23-RES' policy folder. This is so that it will charge them for any asset put under that policy folder. To ensure this is the case don't forget to check the "Bill For All Assets Within Nested Folders" checkbox.

  

3.  Make sure the "Taxable" checkbox is checked if it isn't already, then click "Add Item to Template".

  

Now that the recurring invoice has been created, all that is left is to update the customer's policy folders.

  

The way we currently set up our policy folders is as follows:

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/bb4b8ca4-3390-43fe-a05e-8a23b70f7946/image.png)

The topmost folder will always have the "FOUNDATION" policy attached to it. Then underneath that, you will create a folder for the "M23 - RES" policy (for easier tracking, just name the folders after the policies that they will have assigned to them). Then under the M23 - RES folder, you will make one for the "AV-BEST" policy, which is where the BitDefender antivirus lies. Then under the AV-BEST folder, you will make a final one for the "dataBack" policy. You will not assign a policy or add an asset to this folder unless the customer is paying for the dataBack add-on. In the example above the customer is not paying for dataBack, so we have the folder created, but no policy assigned to it and no asset inside.

  

If you are trying to change an old residential client over to our new AV-BEST policy you will need to do a few extra steps since you need to remove Webroot before BitDefender can be installed. For this what you will want to do is create a temporary folder just under the FOUNDATION policy with no policies attached to it. You will then want to move the asset over to the temporary blank folder and click "Save Changes". Since the asset is no longer under the old Webroot-managed policy, it will remove Webroot from the device, which will then allow Bit Defender to install itself once you move it under the AV-BEST folder (you may want to leave the asset in the temp folder for a few minutes to fully uninstall).

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/131930b5-cc65-4484-b0fa-f56f8ef5a0bd/image.png)

  

If Webroot is still lingering, you can run the "Remove Webroot" script on the asset in the "Scripts" section under the specific asset.

  

Once Webroot is uninstalled (should no longer say the managed AV is Webroot), you can move the asset under the AV-BEST policy folder and click save changes.

  

You are now done, yahoo congrats.

# LHWS - Domain Transfer

LightHost Web Services - Domain Transfer 
=========================================

You can transfer any active domain names to LightHost Web Services by contacting LightHost Web Services and requesting a Domain Transfer. 

  

Once the domain transfer order is completed, you will be asked to **initiate the transfer** by providing the domain's **transfer key** (sometimes referred to as the AUTH code or EPP key) to LightHost Web Services.

  

Before initiating the transfer, you'll want to make sure a few conditions are met:

*   **Unlock your domain**. Most domains will be locked with their current providers to prevent unauthorized transfers. You may be able to unlock your domain directly from your provider's domain management portal or by contacting them directly.
*   Ensure the **email address of the domain's Administrative contact** of your environment is, in fact, an email address that you have access to and that any **Domain Privacy is disabled**. You can view your domain's current information using any [WHOIS lookup tool](https://www.easywhois.com/).
*   Make sure your domain name **has not been registered or transferred in the last 60 days** (if it has, you'll need to wait at least 60 days before proceeding) and is not going to expire in the next five days (if it does, your transfer might fail or your website might go offline mid-process).

  

Relevant information can be requested from your **current domain name provider**. If you are unsure who you've registered your domain name with, please try to find a payment invoice with the company's contact information, perform a [WHOIS lookup](https://www.easywhois.com/) of your domain, or contact us for assistance.

  

For most domain transfers (excluding .CA domains), you will likely be asked to confirm your request by **clicking on a verification link** sent to your domain's administrative email address. Once approved, a domain transfer may take up to 5 days. Certain domain types, such as .ca domains, may transfer within minutes.

  

Once your domain transfer completes, we'll take care of the rest!

  

When you transfer your domain registration, you are also automatically adding one year to your domain's expiration date. So, for example, if your domain expires in 2024 and you transfer it today, its expiry date will be in 2025 with your transfer. This ensures you do not lose any time you have already paid for your domain with another provider.

  

Please get in touch with our support team for immediate assistance if you have any additional questions about your domain's transfer.

# RMM Software

Install RMM software for Windows devices: Open up the "RMM" folder on the Bandit Stick, then either select "Fresh-Setup" if you are installing the software on a fresh Windows installation or "Holding-Only" if Windows has already been set up by the customer, as not to change any settings they might have customized. 

  

Once the RMM software is installed, ensure it isn't pending approval on Syncro. If it is, confirm it is the device you installed the software on, then assign the asset to the corresponding customer profile.

Install RMM software for Apple devices: Essentially the same as the Windows devices, except make sure to use either the "Setup-Apple" or "Holding-Apple" instead of the other 2. You might also need to enable Syncro to have specific permissions during installation. Don’t forget to make sure the asset is not pending approval and to change the owner of the new RMM asset to the customer’s name/profile.

# ISMS ISO 27001 & SOC2

An Information Security Management System (ISMS) that is compliant with ISO 27001 is a comprehensive set of policies and procedures that helps organizations protect their sensitive data and prevent cyber threats. To be compliant with ISO 27001, an ISMS must meet certain requirements related to the management of information security.

Here is a general template that you can use as a starting point for creating an ISMS for your MSP, DigiBandit IT Services, that is compliant with ISO 27001:

1.  Develop a written information security policy that clearly outlines your commitment to protecting sensitive data and outlines the responsibilities of employees, contractors, and other stakeholders. This policy should be based on the requirements of ISO 27001.
2.  Conduct a risk assessment to identify and prioritize potential threats to your organization's sensitive data. This risk assessment should be conducted in accordance with the requirements of ISO 27001.
3.  Implement controls to mitigate identified risks, such as access controls, data encryption, and backup and recovery procedures. These controls should be based on the requirements of ISO 27001.
4.  Establish a process for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of your ISMS on an ongoing basis. This process should be based on the requirements of ISO 27001.
5.  Train employees on information security best practices and ensure that they are aware of their responsibilities under the ISMS. This training should be based on the requirements of ISO 27001.
6.  Regularly test and evaluate the effectiveness of your controls to ensure that they are working as intended. This testing and evaluation should be based on the requirements of ISO 27001.
7.  Implement a process for responding to and recovering from security breaches or incidents. This process should be based on the requirements of ISO 27001.

By following this template and regularly reviewing and updating your ISMS, you can ensure that your MSP, DigiBandit IT Services, is compliant with ISO 27001 and well-prepared to protect sensitive data and prevent cyber threats.

# Change Management

An IT change management template is a document that outlines the process for making changes to an organization's IT systems and infrastructure. It's an essential tool for ensuring that changes are made safely and effectively and don't disrupt business operations. Here is a template for an IT change management process:

  

1.  Request: This step involves receiving a request for a change from a user or team. The request should include a detailed description of the change is requested, the reason for the change, and any supporting documentation.
2.  Review: This step involves reviewing the change request to determine its feasibility and impact on the organization. This may involve consulting with other teams or stakeholders to gather more information or assess the potential risks and benefits of the change.
3.  Approval: This step involves reviewing and approving the change request. This may involve obtaining sign-off from relevant managers or other decision-makers.
4.  Implementation: This step involves implementing the change in a controlled and tested manner. This may involve creating a test environment, developing and testing a plan for the change, and implementing the change in a production environment.
5.  Review: This step involves reviewing the results of the change and assessing its impact on the organization. This may involve gathering user feedback and reviewing performance metrics to determine the success of the change.
6.  Closure: This step involves documenting the change, including any lessons learned and actions taken to address any issues during the change process.

# Incident Responce

Outline steps to be taken in case of an incident or service disruption.

  

1.  Identification: This step involves identifying the incident and determining its impact. This may involve receiving notification of the incident from a user, monitoring system alerts or performing manual checks.
2.  Classification: This step involves classifying the incident based on its severity and impact on the business. This helps to prioritize the incident and determine the appropriate level of resources and attention it requires.
3.  Response: This step involves taking the appropriate action to address the incident. This may involve activating the incident response team, escalating the issue to a higher level of support, or implementing a workaround or temporary fix.
4.  Investigation: This step involves gathering more information about the incident and analyzing the root cause. This helps determine the best course of action for resolving the incident and preventing similar incidents from occurring.
5.  Resolution: This step involves implementing a permanent fix or solution to the incident. It may also involve restoring services or data affected by the incident.
6.  Closure: This step involves documenting the incident, including the steps taken to resolve it and any lessons learned. This helps to improve the incident response process and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

# DNS Filter

[DNSFilter.com](http://DNSFilter.com)

  

[dns.dbits.ca](http://dns.dbits.ca)

  

DNS filtering is defensive software that prevents cybersecurity threats by following simple logic: if a website has something potentially dangerous within it, DNS filtering blocks a user from visiting it in the first place. It’s a zero-trust solution that leaves nothing to chance.

**DNS FILTERING BENEFITS**
--------------------------

\-Stop threats before they hit your network

\-[Granular control](https://www.dnsfilter.com/blog/dns-filtering-how-it-works) over how your network and devices are used

\-Insight into what types of threats might impact your network

\-[Increased productivity](https://www.dnsfilter.com/blog/what-is-dns-filtering) by blocking time-waster sites

\-User-level reporting on sites and apps used by employees

\-Meet [PDNS or CMMC compliance requirements](https://www.dnsfilter.com/blog/why-you-should-filter-dns) around dns filtering protection

# Troubleshooting Customer Label Printer Issues

If the customer label printer is having issues printing out labels, here is a list of things to try:

  

\- Make sure that on the printing page that "Customerlabel" is selected as the printer

  

\- Check if it might have run out of paper

  

\- Unplug then re-plug in all the cables connected to it

  

\- Open up the Auto Printer application on the POS system, go to the "About" section, then click on "Restart Services" and let it do its thing.

# General Repair Prices

When creating a ticket for a customer, the base rate is $90 + tax and includes up to two hours of labour; additional time is at the "repair" rate, products and parts as per the Private ([https://app.clickup.com/24556004/docs/qdcf4-3590/qdcf4-5510](https://app.clickup.com/24556004/docs/qdcf4-3590/qdcf4-5510))

  

Before we can work on their device, this must be paid as a deposit.

  

The base rate covers 2 hours of tracked labour.

*   Waiting for updates and doing drive clones don’t count as work time since those can be done by themselves while we do other things).
*   If the issue can be resolved within this time, the only additional fee the customer must pay is for any parts they may have gotten
    *   ex: if they want an SSD upgrade, they would initially pay the $90 + tax deposit upfront, and then whichever size SSD they picked from our stock would be added to their final invoice, which they would pay for when they come to pick up their device.

  

If the issue takes longer than 2 hours to fix, inform the customer that an additional $30 + hourly tax rate would be added to their final invoice if they would like us to continue.

  

The following are examples of exceptions to the above 2 hours included rule:

*   Microsoft Surface screen replacement which usually takes around 2hrs
    *   Typically we charge base + 1-2 hrs rate due to difficulty and attention.
*   Custom PC builds another exception to the $90 deposit rule.
    *   Custom PC Builds $180 (Base Rate + 3x Hrs)
    *   The estimate is included with Base Rate.
    *   The build is included with 3x Hourly, NBI (Non-Billable Items (cable ties, thermal paste etc.)) is also included in the base rate.

  

Before any parts can be ordered or provided, the customer must first approve the estimate and pay the deposit/invoice/fees.

  

The hourly service rate add-on can be paid when they come to pick up their device.

  

For other services, refer to the “Services” section on [digibandit.com](http://digibandit.com/) for price estimates.

# Clients

When taking client devices, be sure to make a new asset for it on their ticket and mark down the current location of said device (ex: B5 or floor)

  

When creating a ticket for a client (if they are in person), do as above but don’t forget to make a private note about what their issue is, and try to be as detailed as possible (ask questions if needed to get more information on the issue).

  

Don’t forget to change the ticket status after it is made to “Diagnostics required”

  

Print out the intake form so that they can sign it, then use NAPS2 to scan it with “brother feeder”. If the pdf is upside down you can rotate it upright, and if it is a bit crooked, you can straighten it up by selecting rotate, then deskew. Once you’ve done that you can then attach the PDF to the client’s ticket (if you are creating a ticket for them in person).

  

Note: The above-mentioned paragraph is only if the signature device isn’t working.

Tell them the base fee and ask if they need a “Rush Diagnostics” for an additional $60 + tax, if they do then change the priority to urgent and add “diagnostics in-store” in the “add/view charges” section located in the top right-ish area of the screen

  

When a customer comes in to pick up their devices and pay for the services, find their ticket and click on the invoice number. Scroll down until you see the “Balance due”. If they are paying with debit, insert the subtotal only (Square will automatically add tax) on the square application, add a note with their invoice number, and select “charge” at the top right (don’t forget to click “Take payment” at the top of the invoice on Syncro as well). If they are paying with cash, select “Take payment” at the top of the invoice, but on the following screen change the payment method from “Square” to “Cash”, then insert the amount they have given you and it will tell you if you owe them to change or not. After they have paid, email them a copy of the receipt. If they say they want a paper receipt as well, click the printer icon on the top right and print it out (this may take a few seconds so just wait a bit).

  

If a client has 2 invoices, open both of them at the same time (you can do this by clicking on them with the middle mouse wheel button) and select “take payment”. At the top of the following screen, you should see both invoice fees, select that you are receiving both of them and it will show you the combined total.

  

When you are inserting the price into the Square application, don’t forget to add a note with the client's invoice number (if they have 2 invoices just add both separated by a space).

  

Find the lead with the correct description of the client you are looking for (total price, payment method) and assign the lead to the corresponding customer.

  

Note: You currently do not have to do anything with leads anymore.

  

If a customer comes in and you notice they already have a sticker, but they do not have a ticket, instead of making a new customer, look up their name and make a new ticket under their name.

# Other Person Picking up Customer Device

If a customer cannot come to pick up their device themselves and send someone else to do it for them, just ask the customer who will be picking up the device (name of person), and tell them to inform the pickup person to bring a piece of identification so we can confirm who they are.

  

Once the pickup person has arrived, ask for their name and who they are picking up for, as well as their piece of identification. If they hand you a driver's license, scan the bar code on the back and save it as a private note on the ticket and add the words "Pickup person ID" or something similar along with it so we know who picked it up.

  

If the pickup person does not have a piece of ID on them, ask them to call the customer (on speaker phone so we can hear the customer confirm) to confirm that they are indeed the person who is supposed to pick up the device.

# Shipping

To start shipping something, go to the "dbits" folder on the bookmark bar, then select "Shipping", then "Shipping" once again, and then finally "Purolator".

Click on "Create a Shipment", this will bring you to a page that you must fill out with the shipment info. Most of the time you will be shipping to a business that is added to the adressbook, if you click the little person icon next to the bolded "Ship to" near the top, this should bring up a list of businesses that we typically ship things to.

Click on the name of the business you want to make the shipment to (ex: Recovery Force), and this will fill up the shipment info with the information for that business. The only thing you need to add to this section is the "Attention to" box. If we continue with the Recovery Force example, for them this would be their ticket number (Dalton typically makes a private note on the ticket with the RF ticket number, so you can just copy and paste that).

Once that is done, at the bottom right of the page in the "References/Instructions (optional)" section, add **our** ticket number for the customer's drive that we are sending out, then click on next.

On the next page, put in a brief description of the item you are shipping out, with RF it would usually be something along the lines of "Laptop HDD" or something similar. Then in the declared value box, put in the deposit amount that RF charges ($250). Then, if it isn't done by default already, make sure the "Generate return shipment labels to include with your shipment" box is checked off (as we want them to ship the drive back to us), then click on next.

On the Outbound Return page, fill out the description box with the same description you entered previously, then in the declared value box, enter the amount of the recovery the customer is getting (minor recovery = $500, major recovery = $1250), then you would click on "Ship now" if you are shipping it out.

After this, select "Documents", then "Print Daily Manifest", and this will show you the shipments you have made today (there might be 2 even if you only made 1 shipment because of the return shipment). Click on the Lead PIN number and this will bring you to a new page. Click on reports, the select "Domestic Bill of Lading - Laser" as the document type, then submit.

This will bring you to the final page of the process, you should see 2 Domestic Bill of Lading documents, one to ship out, and one for the return. Print both from the "Shipping" printer. Put the return sticker in the package you are shipping out, preferably at the top to make it easier to see, and stick the other one on the Purolator bag and seal the package inside.

Someone should arrive to pick up the package, so you can now just leave it on the front desk and wait.

# Ordering In Parts

If a customer is looking for a specific part or parts that we do not have in store, create a ticket with the "Purchase/Order In" repair type selected and write down what they need in the description (be as specific as possible).

  

Once you find what they are looking for, please create a new estimate on their ticket and add the item as a manual item. For each item, enter the product name, how much it will cost us to buy (don't forget to add shipping and taxes), and then how much it will cost the customer (+20% of what our final cost is after taxes and shipping). Once all the parts are added to the estimate, click on "Process" -> "Publish" to make the estimate viewable for the customer via their customer portal. 

  

Then send them an email (you can use the canned replies) to let them know the estimate is available to approve or decline via their customer portal (add on this link: [https://www.digibandit.com/service-account/](https://www.digibandit.com/service-account/)). Also, let them know that once the estimate is approved, they will need to pay a deposit covering the cost of the part(s) in full before we can order it/them.

  

If they approve the estimate, you can convert it to an invoice. You can send them another email thanking them for approving the estimate and saying that it has been converted to "Invoice #xxxx," which can also be paid via their customer portal. Don't forget to add a link to our payment options page, so they know what payment options we take ([https://www.digibandit.com/payment/](https://www.digibandit.com/payment/)).

If they are looking for a quick rough estimate of the parts, use some of the links in the [WEBSITES](https://dbits.syncromsp.com/documentation/websites) section to search for what you are looking for and let them know (quick being something you can look up without needing to take apart the device to get a more specific part number for example).

# Data Transfer

When copying the data of a client’s drive onto a new one, plug both the client’s drive and the blank new one into the device (for laptops use the USB adapter, for desktops you can just use a SATA cable) and boot from the red USB stick. Once everything has loaded, open up “AOMEI partition assistant”. You should see two drives, one completely empty, and the other with data on it (the client’s drive). Make sure to change the blank drive to either GPT or MBR to match whichever one the client’s drive is, they need to be the same to work. You will then click on the client’s drive and select “Copy Disk”, select “Copy disk quickly”, then select the location (the new blank drive) and check the box at the bottom to optimize the SSD. Next click the middle option “Fit entire disk”, this should be the default option to pick around 90% of the time. After that click “Finish” then “Apply” at the top left of the screen, then “Proceed” to start the process and wait for the copying to finish.

# Copying Data From Macs

Boot from the MacOS Multiboot disk and select the closest compatible version of MacOS, when prompted to enter a password for the DigiBandit user, enter "digital" or “password”. If you have plugged in an external drive to copy the data onto, be sure to format it (with the application directly above carbon copy cloner I forget the name) and make sure to rename that external drive to something you will remember (typically “MacOS”), then open up carbon copy cloner. Select the internal drive as the source, then select the drive you just renamed to be the destination, then click Start at the bottom left and let it do its thing.

Note: When installing the new storage medium, make sure to check if it needs an adapter or not (Macbooks for example might need one if you are using an M.2)

# Creating a Ticket (Repair)

1.  When creating a ticket for a customer, ask if it is their first time at the shop. If it is, then on the "Tickets" section of Syncro, click on the blue "+ New Ticket" button near the top right of the page. If it is not their first time at the shop, ask for their name and look them up on Syncro to find their customer profile. Then, on their customer profile, click on the "New" button near the top right of the "Tickets" section on their account to create a new ticket with their information already filled out.
    1.  If it is their first time in the shop, after clicking on the blue "+ New Ticket" button, you will need to fill out their first name, last name, email, and preferably a phone number if they have one.
2.  Once their personal information is filled out, scroll down to the next section. The "Ticket Summary" section is where you will fill out what their issue is. Write down a brief line of what their issue is in the "Subject" bar, then in "Issue Type" select what option best corresponds with their issue (ex: a generic PC repair would go under the "Repair" issue type). Then in 'Description" just enter a brief description in slightly more detail about what is wrong with their device, and what the customer would like to be done if they have a specific request.
    1.  Ex - Subject: Spilled water on the laptop
    
    Issue Type: Repair
    
    Description: Spilled water on the laptop, if the laptop cannot be fixed with a basic liquid damage repair, then remove the hard drive and try to recover as much data as possible.
    
3.  After the ticket summary has been filled out, scroll all the way down and hit "Save". This will then bring you to the intake form page where you will need to get a signature from the customer. Once on this page, hand the customer the laminated intake form page, and explain to them the main points (ex: tell them they must pay a $90 + tax deposit upfront before we can do anything and that this covers up to 2 hours of work which in most cases should cover the whole ticket except for any additional parts. If we must go over 2 hours then we will notify the customer that extra charges may be applied if they want to proceed, typically this would be the hourly $30 + tax rate. Also, inform them about any data loss that may occur if applicable to their type of repair. For example, if they want a fresh Windows installation, inform them that unless they want us to back up their data, this would erase all of their documents/files.) If they agree to the terms and conditions, you can click on the green "Start Signing" button at the bottom of the intake form page, and hand the customer the stylus so they can sign on the signature pad.
4.  Once the signature is saved, you will be brought automatically to the new ticket's page. You will then want to click on the "Actions" drop-down near the top right of the screen and then click on 'Take Deposit" third down from the top. On the deposit page, enter the deposit amount (typically $90) and this will create a new invoice of that amount + tax under the customer's ticket.
5.  Once the invoice is made ask if the customer would like to pay with cash or with a card. if they would like to pay with cash, simply click on "Take payment" on the invoice, but change the payment type to "Cash" on the next screen and enter the amount they hand you. Syncro will automatically tell you how much change is owed if any.
    1.  If the customer would like to pay with a card (debit/credit, etc) click on "Take Payment" and on the next page, make sure the payment method is set to "Square" if not already. Then go to the Square page on the web browser and enter the invoice number in the format of "INV#xxxx" in the notes section on Square, with "xxxx" being the number of the invoice. Then enter the amount without taxes in the amount section, and click on take payment. This will then pop up on the Square terminal for the customer to tap or insert their card.
6.  Once the payment has gone through (for Square, just wait until you see the green checkmark on the web page), Syncro will bring you back to the same invoice page, but you will see a green "Paid" bar under invoice details indicating that the invoice has been marked as paid. You will then want to click on the "Actions" drop-down, then on "Email", and then on "Send Email" to send them an email receipt of the invoice.
    1.  If the customer would like a paper version of the receipt, you can scroll down a bit to the "Applied Payments" section on the left-hand side and click on the PDF icon next to the latest payment. Then on the following view PDF page, click on the printer icon and select "Receipts" as the printer if it isn't already selected, and then print out their receipt and hand it to them.
7.  Once the customer leaves, add his device as an asset on the ticket, by either clicking "New" under the "Relevant Assets" section, or by clicking "Add Existing" if the device has already been added as an asset before (usually from a previous ticket).
    1.  If you are adding a new ticket, select the asset type (laptop, desktop, console, data, etc) and then fill out as much information as possible. The most important usually is the serial number and model number if there are any, as well as the brand. you can also enter the user password if any. Then just enter a generic name as the asset name, usually, it would be the brand followed by the model number or type of device. you can also check off the corresponding boxes if the customer left any USB dongles, chargers, or cases with us that belong to the asset.
8.  Once the asset is made, a label should be printed out automatically for you to stick on the underside of the device, if not, simply click on the three dots to the right of the new asset, and click 'Print".
9.  Finally, don't forget to mark the location of the device if you are not going to be working on it right away. Put the device in a vacant cubby on the pickup bench, and then mark which cubby in the "Custom Fields 9Asset Location)" section at the very top of the customer's ticket. You will want to click "Edit", select "Asset Location" as the Custom Field Type, and then under the "Holding" section mark the cubby (ex: A-2). The cubbies go from top to bottom, left to right, with the leftmost column being the "A" column, the middle one being "B", and the rightmost being "C". So the top left cubby would be "A-1" and the bottom right cubby would be "C-8"

# Printing Out Worksheet Checklists

To print out a worksheet using the receipt printer, simply add the worksheet to the ticket you want, then click on the three dots, then select "Print". On the printing page, you will want to select the "Receipts" printer, set margins to "Minimal", and set the scale to 70%. Then once you print out the worksheet it should come out perfectly sized on the receipt paper in a checklist format.

# Same Day Diagnostics

We are currently not providing same-day diagnostics. The customer pays the $120 diagnostic fee regardless of the issue. If their device can be fixed on the same day they drop it off, then great, but we tell them it usually can take up to 2-3 business days or longer depending on the issue. 

  

If they require a part to be ordered, we usually tell them it can take 7 business days, unless specified otherwise by the supplier's ETA.

# General Prices

When creating a ticket for a customer, the base rate/diagnostics fee is $90 + tax. This must be paid as a deposit upfront when they drop off their device.

  

This deposit covers diagnostics and about ~2 hours of work (waiting for Windows updates and doing clones of drives do not count as work time, since we can let it do that while we do something else). If the issue can be resolved within this time, the only other additional fee the customer must pay is for any parts they want (ex: if they want an SSD upgrade, it would be the initial $90 + tax, and the price of whatever size SSD they want).

  

You can track the time you spend on a ticket with the timer on the customer's ticket, or if you forget you can manually add how much time you spend with the "View Log" button.

  

If the issue is something that requires more than ~2 hours, the customer then will have to be contacted and informed that if they wish to continue with the ticket, they will have to be charged our hourly rate ($30/hour). An example of something that will take longer than the ~2 hours would be a Microsoft Surface screen replacement (the base price for this would still be $90 + tax, but depending on how cracked the screen is, let the customer know it might take an additional 1-2 hours). 

  

Custom PC builds are the exception to the $90 + tax base rate. They are priced as the following:

\- Custom PC build estimates are $30 + tax, as it can take time to search for all the parts, make sure they are compatible, and make sure the build falls within the customer's budget.

\- Custom PC builds are $120 + tax. For invoices, the bundle product name should be "Bundle - Standard Service Package", and should include the $90 diagnostic fee along with 1 hour of repair for $30, totaling $120 (you can also just search "SSP' and it should appear as a product).

For all parts to be ordered, the customer must first approve the estimate and then pay the invoice in full before we can order the parts. The hourly service rate add-on can be paid when they come to pick up their device.

For other services, prices refer to the “Services” section on [digibandit.com](http://digibandit.com) for price estimates.

# our repair process

**our repair process**
======================

### **Step-by-Step**

Create a ticket at [DigiBandit.com/ticket](https://www.digibandit.com/ticket), or stop by, and we’ll do it for you!

After we get your device and deposit, we’ll test, inspect, diagnose and attempt to fix your device.

We’ll send you a diagnostics report, an estimate for parts/labour, and upgrade suggestions!

  

**_If you approve the estimate:_**  
We’ll collect a deposit (needed),  
Order your parts, and once received,  
Repair your device!

  

**_If you decline the estimate:_**  
Since your deposit covers everything until this point,  
Your device will be available for pickup!  
P.S. Sometimes, we purchase devices for parts, ask!

  

Once the device is repaired, we’ll set a time and date for you to collect your device.

Once you’re ready to collect your device, pay the invoice, collect the device, and you're on your way!

  

### **Fees & Paperwork**

The diagnostic service fee covers our time diagnosing your device, providing estimates, and performing the standard repairs that most people need!

If additional time, parts, or charges are needed, we’ll get your approval before moving forward!

Additional deposits may be collected to cover the cost of parts we don’t usually have in stock. This is just in case we don’t ever see you again (sadly, it happens).

The intake form (signed when creating a ticket for the first time) explains what we are doing and covers more legal ground.

### **Service Fees**

If additional time, parts, or we anticipate exceeding the estimated cost, we’ll reach out for approval!

### **Discounts**

While we offer many different discounts, any and all discounts, credits etc., can only be used on service fees unless otherwise stated.

If you want to save some more money on your repair, bring us your old/broken/etc. Devices for in-store credit!

# Bandit Stick

The Bandit Stick has multiple folders on it. The main ones we would be using are the "Program Files" and "RMM" folders.

  

The "RMM" folder is used to install the DigiBandit support software on systems. There are installers for both Windows devices and macOS devices. You can see more about how to use this folder here: [**RMM Software**](https://app.clickup.com/24556004/v/dc/qdcf4-3130/qdcf4-3942)

  

The "Program Files" folder is where some useful everyday tools/programs are. Tools like CPUID to see more information on a system, or DDU to uninstall any unwanted display drivers (useful when switching from Nvidia GPUs to AMD ones for example).

  

The "FABs" folder is where you will find the "AutoBackup7Pro" application, which is used for transferring files from one Windows installation to another. You simply plug both of the drives in, then select the source Windows user from the drive you want, then the destination user from the other drive. We use this software sometimes when having to do fresh Windows installations either due to corrupted system files, or very old versions of Windows that cannot be brought up to date and are missing important security updates, but the customer would like to keep their files. Or even during SSD upgrades if AOMEI does not want to work for some reason.

  

AutoBackup7Pro does not carry over applications (you will see the files, but will need to reinstall the applications themselves), as well as the licenses for them (will need to reactive or sign back in as well for the applications that require so).

# Fresh Windows 10 Installs

When doing a fresh install of Windows 10, always make sure you are installing it on the M.2 or SSD if there are any. Delete all old partitions and click on “new” to make new ones. You should have 3 partitions total, make sure you select the biggest one before continuing with the installation. If you do not see 3 partitions when creating new ones, cancel the download and go into the bios. Try disabling Legacy boot and enabling UEFI if it isn’t already. If that still doesn’t work try disabling secure boot. 

For Windows 10, create an offline account (do not select a network to connect to, as this will prompt you to create a Microsoft account), make the Username “DigiBandit”, or the customer's name, and click next when it asks for a password (so there is no password).

  

For Windows 11, go through all of the steps for the fresh install, but when it gets to the step where you need to connect to a network (this is unskippable in Windows 11), plug in an ethernet cable to be directly connected, then on the very next step, unplug the ethernet cable to disconnect from the internet. This will then prompt the hidden offline user creation page, and you can proceed the same way you would in Windows 10. Make the user "DigiBandit", or the customer's name, and do not enter a password.

  

Once you can see the desktop, download all available Windows and driver updates to alleviate the need for the customer to do so.

Don’t forget to also download and install the corresponding support software for the device you are using (if it is Lenovo, download the Lenovo support assistant, if it is Dell, download the Dell assistant, etc.), as well as install our own support software (if bandit stick is unavailable, use an incognito tab and download it from the self serve page on our website).

  

Once our support software has been installed and the pending approval has been approved (sometimes it automatically gets approved), make sure to go find the asset on Syncro and assign it to the corresponding customer. You can confirm the asset name by hovering over the support software icon on the device, or if the support software background is there, the asset name should be displayed at the top sometimes as well.

# Make Windows Pro

How to Upgrade Windows 10 Home to Pro Using an Upgrade Key and SLMGR
====================================================================

While Windows 10 Home in and of itself is a great operating system, some people seek out the advanced features of the Pro edition. Today’s article will focus on how you can upgrade your copy of Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro using a dummy key provided by Microsoft, and a real product key.

Why should you update from Windows 10 Home to Pro?
--------------------------------------------------

The biggest difference between the two systems is their security. The Pro version comes with way better protection against cyber threats, allowing you to comfortably keep even sensitive materials on your computer. Some other, additional features include domain linking and a Remote Desktop.

If you want to learn how you can update from a Windows 10 Home system to Windows 10 Pro with the SLMGR command, you’re in the right place. This method allows you to upgrade without having to reinstall your entire device or sit through hours of upgrade screens.

**Note**: You might be required to have access to an administrator account to perform all of the steps described below. If the account you’re currently using doesn’t have administrative permissions, make sure to change this in your settings or contact your IT professional.

Let’s not waste any more time and get right to the guide. Make sure to follow the steps described below accurately to ensure you don’t run into any errors during the upgrade process.

1.  Make sure you have your **Windows 10 Pro product key** ready. You can purchase product keys from various online retailers, or the official Microsoft website. You should receive a 25-character long key that’ll allow you to activate Windows 10 Pro after the upgrade process.
2.  For this method to work, you need to turn your internet off completely. Here are the steps depending on what type of connection you’re using:
3.  For **wireless (Wi-Fi)** follow these steps:
4.  Click on the **Network** icon in your taskbar notification area. This should open a sliding tab with a list of detected wireless networks listed.
5.  Click on the **Wi-Fi** button to temporarily disable your Wi-Fi.
6.  For **cabled (Ethernet)** follow these steps:
7.  Right-click on the **Network** icon in your taskbar notification area, then select **Open Network & Internet settings**.
8.  Click on the Change adapter options link. A new window should appear.
9.  Right-click on your wired connection, then select **Disable** from the context menu.
10.  After temporarily turning off your connection to the internet, open the Settings application using the **Windows** + **I** keyboard shortcut.
11.  Click on the **Update & Security** tab, then choose **Activation** from the sidebar menu.
12.  Scroll down until you see the **Activate Windows now** section. Here, you need to click on the **Change product key** link. A new window should appear.
13.  Enter the following Windows 10 Pro dummy key provided by Microsoft: **VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T**
14.  With the internet disabled, you’ll be able to convert Windows 10 Home into Windows 10 Pro. Wait for the process to finish and allow your computer to restart.
15.  After the automatic reboot, your computer will be on Windows 10 Pro, however, you still have to activate it with your own product key to validate the license.
16.  Start your system and open the **Command Prompt** in one of the following ways:
17.  Using the search function in your taskbar, look up **Command Prompt**. When you see it in the results, right-click on it and choose **Run as Administrator**.
18.  Press the **Windows** + **R** keys on your keyboard to bring up the **Run** utility. Type in “**cmd**” and press the **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **Enter** keys on your keyboard. Doing so, you’re launching the Command Prompt with administrative permissions.
19.  Press the **Windows** + **X** keyboard shortcut, then select **Command Prompt (Admin)**.
20.  If prompted, click **Yes** to allow the Command Prompt to make changes on your device. You might be required to input the administrator password as well.
21.  Type in the following command, complete with your 25 character product key formatted this way: **SLMGR /ipk xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx**
22.  Hit the **Enter** key on your keyboard. You should see a dialogue box pop up on your screen, informing you about the activation of your product key.

### How to check if you successfully converted Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro

After completing the steps in the section above, your system should be successfully activated with the Windows 10 Pro version. You can double-check this by following this short guide:

1.  Open the **File Explorer**.
2.  Right-click on **This PC** and choose **Properties**.
3.  Check the **Windows edition** section. It should display Windows 10 Pro with the architecture of your system.

We hope that our article was able to help you upgrade from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro with ease. Enjoy the advanced protection and new, unique features with your operating system upgrade!

# MacOS Installs

#### For macOS Installs, if the customer doesn’t mind losing their data, or just wants a fresh install, you can boot from the macOS hard drive and select the “DigiBandit” account (the password should be "digital" or “password”). Once in, go to Disk Utility located above the Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) application on the desktop. Once in there, select the partition located second most to the top and erase it (make sure it's the one that says it has the MacOS on it). It will ask you to rename the partition, just rename it to the device (ex: MacBook Pro) and continue. After this is done you can close out of the application and open up the copy disk application. Select the desired macOS version as the source, and select the newly renamed partition as the destination drive. After that’s done, just click clone on the bottom right and wait. Once it’s done copying, restart the device and unplug the boot drive from it. There should be a DigiBandit account on the device now since you made a copy of the boot disk. Log back into it, select system preferences, Users, and Groups, and click the lock icon to make some changes. Firstly disable the guest account, then create a new Admin user with the same name as the customer and make the password “digital”. Once this is done. Log out of the DigiBandit account and log into the new customer account. Once logged in, go to the same place as before and delete the DigiBandit account without saving anything.

  

**FRESH INSTALLS**

  

After using Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the boot drive, a better way to do a fresh install would be to restart the Mac and hold down the "Options" key to then boot to the recovery volume. You will then want to go to the internal disk that you copied the drive to and click on "Erase" leaving all the settings the way they are by default.

  

After you do this, go back to the recovery volume and select "Reinstall macOS". This will reinstall the version of macOS currently on your drive, but if you didn't erase the disk, this would not have erased the data from the macOS boot drive. With this, the Mac will do its thing then restart and act as if it's new from the box with no data on it whatsoever.

# Password Bypass

For Windows devices, if a customer can no longer log in to their account, you can boot from the red USB stick open up “NTedit” and change the password to usually “digital” or something simple.

For Mac, press and hold “Command + R” when booting up the device and go into the terminal from the utility section. Once in the terminal type “resetpassword” and hit enter. Closeout of the terminal and follow the prompts of the password reset tool.

# Laptop Screens

Replacement Part Types
======================

One laptop model can be manufactured with different display options:

\- non-touch screen,

\- on-cell touch display,

\- touch screen display assembly (digitizer layer glued on top of the screen).

  

**Non-touch Display** can be replaced by:

\- LCD Screen with the same specifications [(info)](https://www.laptopscreen.com/English/section/Articles/?mode=5&view_article=1525805176)

\- OLED Screen with the same specifications [(info)](https://www.laptopscreen.com/English/section/Articles/?mode=5&view_article=1588981180)

LCD Mounting and LCD brackets
=============================

Typical LCDs are mounted with 2, 3 or 4 screws on the left and the right side of the LCD.

  

Some LCDs are mounted via built-in brackets.

  

Important! All product images match the exact bracket configuration of a replacement screen that will be sent to you. LCD brackets are built onto the LCD module - don't confuse them with the LCD mounting brackets that are part of a laptop and should be unscrewed from the LCD and reused during the reinstallation process.

  

Examples of LCD mountings:

* * *

Determine your LCD screen model number
======================================

To find out the LCD screen model number you need to take the screen out of the laptop and check the back of the LCD screen.

  

On the back side of the screen, you can see one or several labels with numbers. 99% of the screens on the market today have the manufacturer's code and screen size included in the model number. For example, screen model number **B101AW06** means that the screen is manufactured by AU Optronics and this screen's diagonal size is 10.1".

  

Below is a list of the most common laptop LCD screen manufacturers with their abbreviations:

  

AU Optronics - B

BOE Hydis - HB

Chi Mei / Innolux - N

Chunghwa - CLAA

HannStar - HSD

IVO - M

LG Display - LP

Samsung - LTN

Sharp - LQ or LM

Toshiba - LTM or LTD

  

Below are examples of what most common laptop LCD manufacturer's model labels look like:

Screen connector
================

There are several different types of video connectors used in laptops screens. For the most part the connectors are not interchangeable. Here are the most common types of video connectors that are in use today:

![](https://www.laptopscreen.com/media/1508175591/30pin_a.jpg)

**30-pin eDP** - the main modern connector.

It is used on screens with resolutions up to 1920 x 1080. If your laptop was manufactured after 2014 and features screen resolution up to 1080p it is likely using this type of connector.

  

![](https://www.laptopscreen.com/media/1508175591/PastedGraphic-3.png)

**40-pin Narrow Connector**

40-pin touch interface and eDP video connector used on some Lenovo laptops starting from 2020.

  

Narrow 40pin - pitch 0.4mm (found in Lenovo OnCell touch)

Regular 40pin - pitch 0.5mm

![](https://www.laptopscreen.com/media/1508175591/x40pinLCDLEDU03.jpg)

**40-pin same physical connector standard but 3 different and incompatible signals**

  

**40-pin eDP Touch** - used on newer laptops after 2015, the additional pins over the 30-pin eDP connector are needed for a built-in (on-cell) touchscreen functionality.

  

**40-pin eDP QHD+** - used on newer laptops after 2015, the additional pins over the 30-pin eDP connector are needed for higher resolution options such as QHD (2560 x 1440) and even higher (4 channel eDP).

  

"40-pin eDP Touch" LCDs are not interchangeable with "40-pin eDP QHD+" screens. Even though the connectors are the same, plugging a "40-pin eDP Touch" LCD in-place of a "40-pin eDP QHD+" screen will not provide the touch functionality, and vice-versa, plugging a QHD screen in place of a 40-pin touchscreen will not provide higher resolution.

  

  

  

**40-pin LVDS (old)**

  

Used on most LED back-lit laptops prior to 2014. It was the most common standard at the time and allowed resolutions up to 1920 x 1080p.

Screens fitted with 40-pin LVDS connector are not interchangeable with screens fitted with 40-pin eDP because of the two different signalling technologies, even-though the connectors follow identical physical standards.

  

  

**Other**

  

120Hz+ LVDS (gaming) screens used a 50-pin connector

CCFL screens (obsolete) used 20-pin LVDS and 30-pin LVDS connectors.

MacBooks use their own proprietary LVDS and eDP connector types.

# Teardowns

For disassembling devices you aren’t familiar with, refer to either “[IFIXIT](https://www.ifixit.com/)” or [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) and look up your device.

# Audit Mode Windows

**Works with Windows 10/11**

  

After doing a fresh Windows installation, once you get to the OOBE screen where it asks for your region, you can press Ctrl + Shift + F3 at the same time to open Audit Mode.

  

What Audit Mode does is essentially log you straight into the system's Administrator account without having to do the initial Windows setup, so you can let the customer do that when they get a hold of their system.

  

Once you get to the desktop, you should see a window pop up that chooses what happens when you reboot the system, leave that alone for now as if you click 'OK" it will execute what action is listed. By default, System Cleanup Action should be set to "Enter System Out-Of-Box Experience (OOBE), and the shutdown option should be set to "Restart" (if not then set them to these options). Before clicking "OK" on the pop-up window install the DigiBandit Support Software, along with any updates and drivers that the device might need to properly function.

  

Once you are done, you can simply restart the device with the help of the pop-up window by clicking on the "OK" button and you should be back to the initial Windows setup wizard.

# "We couldn't find any drives" Windows install fix

If you are trying to do a fresh Windows 10/11 install, and on the "Where do you want to install Windows?" screen, it says, "We couldn't find any drives," even though there is a drive connected, you will most likely need to install IRST drivers (Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver).

  

Firstly, download the IRST drivers if you haven't already here: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19617/intel-rapid-storage-technology-raid-for-windows-10-64-bit-for-nuc10i7fn-nuc10i5fn-nuc10i3fn.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19617/intel-rapid-storage-technology-raid-for-windows-10-64-bit-for-nuc10i7fn-nuc10i5fn-nuc10i3fn.html).

  

Once downloaded for the correct OS, unzip the file to a USB drive.

  

Once extracted and put onto the USB drive, safely eject the USB and prep the device you want to install Windows on.

  

Once you get to the part of the Windows installation where you have to select the drive you want to install it on, plug in the USB with the extracted IRST drivers, then click on "Load Driver" near the bottom left, then "Browse" to navigate to the location of the driver.

  

Select the drop-down of the USB drive, and select the F6 folder; then you should see two options, select the topmost and click on next. The drives should now appear.

# How to Create an Xbox Boot Drive

This works with both SATA-based SSDs and HDDs

  

Once you have your drive formatted and ready (it needs to be formatted to be recognized by Windows), plug it into the PC with the help of an adapter and open up a CMD as an Administrator.

  

You will need to download the latest version of the xboxhdd-master script if you do not already have it. You can download it from this forum post here: [https://gbatemp.net/threads/xbox-one-internal-hard-drive-upgrade-or-repair-build-any-size-drive-that-works-on-any-console.496212/](https://gbatemp.net/threads/xbox-one-internal-hard-drive-upgrade-or-repair-build-any-size-drive-that-works-on-any-console.496212/)

  

Once the folder has been downloaded and extracted, you will type the command "cd C:\\Users\\(Your Name)\\Downloads\\xboxonehdd-master-9\\xboxonehdd-master\\win" where "(Your Name)" is replaced with your Windows user name.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/7c33cb8a-9ca9-47e7-bf4b-8ec2569ea304/image.png)

Please note that at the time of writing this, the current version is "9", but if there happens to be a later version, change the "9" in the script to whichever version you are using).

  

Once this is done, enter the command "create\_xbox\_drive".

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/3b503a08-72b7-4336-ade0-8b182381f493/image.png)

  

Once you press a key, you will be prompted to select what you are trying to do; you will usually select the option "a" to create a new drive from scratch.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/e8065a93-157e-4ecf-bfc6-80fd1288f59d/image.png)

  

You will then have to select what drive you want to use. NEVER select drive 0, as that is usually your operating system.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/29674609-7366-4e43-905b-bdafff792da5/image.png)

  

Next, select the size of the drive you want, this is typically the same size as the disk you are using.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/e850d976-8126-4f5c-9774-c00a7d5a21d0/image.png)

  

Once the command line displays 6 lines of long numbers with "GUID" at the top, the command line is finished and you can close the CMD. But don't remove the drive from the computer just yet.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/5ddc1944-884b-4860-81c3-caedc5872bf3/image.png)

  

You will next want to download the Xbox OSU1 file. Here is the link if you do not already have it: [https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/offline-system-update](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/offline-system-update)

  

Then, navigate to the newly created System Update (X:) drive and create two folders, one labelled "A" and one "B".

  

Extract all of the files from OSU1, copy everything in $SystemUpdate, except for "updater.xvd", and paste these files into the folders "A" and "B" that you created.

  

Then, copy "updater.xvd" from $SystemUpdate and paste it in the root of System Update (X:)

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/2897ce10-81ea-4fe5-a308-781b796c845f/image.png)

  

You will need to download the bootanim.dat and store it in folders "A" and "B". There are two different versions you can download, one for OG / S or the X. Without the file, the Xbox will boot with a black screen to the menu and not the boot logo. You can download the bootanim.dat files here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q-HL2atZN4BQaRtXbEk4SWLVfhLxHlF9](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q-HL2atZN4BQaRtXbEk4SWLVfhLxHlF9)

  

Edit (02/16/2023): Saved some of the important Xbox files to the shared network storage Tartarus sts

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/976f4265-60ae-4e99-bb41-9df91bff291d/image.png)

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/41690fcd-8182-4c64-869c-3fb6aa36d49c/image.png)

The bootanim.datfile should be the up to date one from 2023.

# Adding a Product/Service

### Overview

Inventory is the module we place all Products & Services in that you might sell. It's both a primary tab on the site navigation, and an overarching concept that includes Purchasing, Vendors, Purchase Orders, Stock Take, and lots more.

_Note: Our Products & Services module is also known as our Inventory module. It is most commonly referred to as Inventory in the app, but we labeled the main page as Products & Services since many MSPs do not have inventory. The terms are used interchangeably._

### What It Does

*   Tracks the items (both products and services) that you will sell
*   You can choose to maintain stock at the item level
*   Fully Serialized - meaning we track down to the individual instance
*   You can store individual serial numbers on each item if you want
*   Batch Tracking from Purchase Orders ties instances to Vendors
*   Set reorder level, desired quantity, cost, retail, categories, tons more
*   One-Click electronic ordering available for select vendors
*   Pending Orders page - All your reordering in one place

### What It Doesn't Do

*   Variants like Size: Small, Medium, Large (you have to just duplicate the item)

Adding a Product
----------------

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zu42oZL.png)

**Steps for Adding a Product**

_Click on the "Products and Services" tab and then click on the blue button that says "New Item" to get started._

![](https://i.imgur.com/WOOGoS1.png)

**UPC Code:** This is where you will add your own Universal Product Code(UPC). Our system will generate a barcode for you using this number.

**Retail Product or Service:** Indicates that the item is a product or service

**Discount - Amount/Percent:** Use this if you want to create a Percentage discount that can be added as a line item on an invoice. Categorize this as a discount and it becomes a trackable item in your "Product Sales Report"

**Price Retail:** This is the Price for your customer.

**Price Cost:** This is what you paid to purchase this product

**Taxable:** This checkbox indicates whether the item is "taxable" or not. Leave it unchecked if the item should be tax free

**Notes:** This is a box to add any notes that will be used internally for this product.

**Maintain Stock:**Checking this box will allow you track quantity, order from purchase orders, and get alerts when an item is running low on stock.

**Serialized:**Check this box if you have items you would like to track using a serial number.

**One Time Use:**Check this box if you would like the system to disable the product once it reaches a quantity of 0

**Re-order At:** This will trigger a pending "Low Stock" request and will alert you if you have a notification set.

**Desired Stock level:** The system will create a pending order to bring you back to this "desired stock level" when you hit your re-order point

**Quantity:**This is the amount of items you have in stock

**Category:**You can categorize items to organize them and certain categories will trigger other features in the system e.g. "Labor", "Pre-Pay Hours", "Deposit"

**Sort Order:**This allows you to set certain products into a higher position on your inventory list so that they are easier to find. Users will sort by order of importance.

**Physical Location:** Where the item is located physically in your shop

**Condition:**The condition the item is in e.g. "New","Used"

**Warranty Template:**This will allow you to assign Warranties to Products so that when the product is sold the Warranty gets added to the customer's record. You will need to create a warranty template first to use this feature. [Learn to create warranty templates!](https://community.syncromsp.com/t/warranty-templates/2241)

* * *

One Time Use Inventory Products
-------------------------------

One Time Use Inventory Products are products that you have on-hand and want to sell to customers, but you do not want to consider them a permanent part of your Inventory and re-stock them when you run out. This feature automatically disables the product once it is out of stock.

### How to use

First get started by enabling this at: _Admin > Inventory > Preferences > Enable One-Time-Use Products_, shown here:

![](https://i.imgur.com/iYCAskB.png)

When you create a new Inventory Product or modify an existing one, you will be able to see the checkbox for OTU here:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Hd0JclK.png)

You will also see the "One Time Use" checkbox when adding a new Manual Product to a Purchase Order. Click on the "Manual Add" button in the Purchase Order next to the "_ADD 'MAINTAIN STOCK' PRODUCT FROM INVENTORY_" box, then you will see the checkbox at the bottom of the pop-up window:

![](https://i.imgur.com/QXlhtY2.png)

### Things to note

Backordering a One-Time-Use Product is not recommended as they are designed to be disabled and not re-ordered

* * *

Pending Orders
--------------

### Overview

Pending orders page allows you to view and fulfill orders created through the low stock triggers and pending orders triggered on invoices.

### What it does

*   Automatically triggers pending orders based on stock levels
*   Allows you to add pending orders or low stock to an existing or new Purchase order
*   Track Pending and Low Stock orders on one page
*   Fulfill orders on invoices after the check-in step of a purchase order

### What it doesn't do

*   Order the items automatically

### Enabling Pending Orders

To enable Pending orders,

1.  Navigate to **Admin > Inventory - Preferences**.
2.  Click **Additional Settings**.
3.  Click the **Enable the Backorder feature** box.
4.  Click **Save**.

Once you have enabled the Backorder feature, go to the **Products & Services** tab, click the **Inventory Module** dropdown and you will see a new **Pending Orders** option.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XKIAtKl.png)

### How Pending Orders work

Once the Backorder feature is enabled, it will deduct your inventory past 0 into the negative quantities, these negatives will then show up on the Pending Orders page.

For instance, if you add more items than are currently in stock, these items will show up as Pending in both the Invoice and Product pages. In the example below the original Product had 10 items in stock, but on the invoice 20 was requested. The system then reserved the initial 10 items and added the rest as requested on the Pending Orders page.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GThBiyd.png)

### How Low Stock inventory works

Desired Stock levels in the Product Detail page triggers the low stock pending orders. When an item is added to Low stock, Syncro is trying to get the product at the desired stock level set in the Product detail page.

In the example below, the Desired Stock level is set at 20 and the Reorder at is set at 2. Once the item reaches 2 it will create a pending order for 18 items to be ordered so the product can get to the desired stock level.

![](https://i.imgur.com/OyE4z7z.png)

If you go to the Pending orders page (Products & Services > Inventory Modules > Pending Orders), you will see the item is now back-ordered and marked as Low-Stock, with an In-Stock Quantity of 2, Requested 18.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3z9jd1w.png)

### Adding Low Stock & Pending orders to a Purchase order

There are two ways to add low stock and pending orders to a PO. The first is to check the box by the desired pending order(s) and, in the upper right, click **Add to PO**. Then select if you want to create a new PO or add the order(s) to an existing PO.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gGkHFwh.png)

The second is to go to the purchase order you wish to add these items to. Below the PO details, you will find three options—**Add All Low Stock Items**, **Add Low Stock Items by this Vendor**, and **Add All Pending Items**. Click the one(s) you want.

![](https://i.imgur.com/INCjVS1.png)

| **Add All Low Stock Items** | **Add All Low Stock Items by this Vendor** | **Add All Pending Items** | **Email to Vendor** |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Adds all items that are below your desired stock level | Adds items that are below your desired stock level for a particular vendor only | Adds all Pending Orders to the Purchase Orders, to learn more follow this link | This will trigger an email of your purchase order to the vendor to start the order process |

After you have added your low stock and pending orders you can add other items or set the Status to **Ordered** when done.

### Fulfill Pending orders on invoice

You can fulfill a pending order on an invoice as follows.

1.  Go to the invoice.
2.  Next to the back ordered item and under the QTY column, click the **Pending** link.
3.  Check the box by the pending order.
4.  In the upper right, click **Add to PO**.
5.  Select the desired PO and click **Existing**.
6.  Change the Status dropdown to **Check-In**.
7.  Next to the item, click the green **Receive** button.
8.  In the dialog, check the FULFILL check box.
9.  Click **Fulfill**.

When you receive those items on a PO and fulfill them, this will allocate those items to your existing pending orders (instead of moving them to "In Stock" in your inventory).

Product Upsells
---------------

You can use product upsells to create upsell opportunities for your customers. You can use product upsells with other products or an entire category of products. Upsells work with the POS, invoice, and estimates modules.

To create an upsell opportunity, head to the Products & Services page and select the product you want to upsell. Then navigate to the 'Upsell Opportunities' tab:

![](https://i.imgur.com/HFt6Zyy.png)

You can then choose to add an upsell by searching for a product or a category:

![](https://i.imgur.com/GV5YVAh.png)

You can add more than one product as an upsell opportunity or a category that will list all products in that category for the upsell. ![](https://i.imgur.com/GGls1WL.png)![](https://i.imgur.com/65f5B6V.png)

Once you have saved the products to upsell, they will then show up as an upsell opportunity when creating invoices, estimates, or using the POS system.

**Please note:** You must enable the upsell opportunities option in [invoice settings 1](https://community.syncromsp.com/t/invoice-settings/2233), [estimate settings 1](https://community.syncromsp.com/t/estimates-settings/2234), and POS settings as they work independently from one another.

Once the product upsell has been saved, you will see the opportunities pop up on the screen when the product is added as a line item on an invoice, estimate, or chosen in the POS.

# Powershell Scripts

Make a 1 Liner PowerShell script:
=================================

Take any Powershell script. It doesn’t have to be a 1-liner. Then surround it with the following code:

```plain
$code = {
	#Put your code here
}
[convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($code))
```

Then it will output a 64-digit encoded string.

Use the one-liner string as follows (This string is a popup that shows your hostname):

```plain
powershell -EncodedCommand CODE-FROM-ABOVE-GOES-HERE
```

You have successfully converted a complete script to a 1-liner for the tray icon.

# Leads

Leads, found in the "Leads" section on Syncro ([https://dbits.syncromsp.com/leads](https://dbits.syncromsp.com/leads)), are requests or questions from customers who either send us emails without replying to their current opened ticket (or they don't have an open ticket yet) or can also be voicemails left to us by clients.

  

If the lead corresponds to an existing ticket, you can merge the lead with an existing ticket with the ticket number, or you can use the lead to simply create a new ticket.

# [PPG] Policy, Procedure, and Guide

**Policy**  
A policy establishes **a standard by which the institution manages its affairs.** A policy mandate specifies or prohibits conduct from enhancing the institution’s mission, ensuring coordinated compliance with applicable laws and regulations, promoting operational efficiency, and/or reducing institutional risk.

Policy Name
===========

This is a short description of what the policy is, in a nutshell. When we mention Standard Operating Procedures (SoP), we refer to our Policy, Procedure, and Guide \[PPG\] documents.

  

A PPG is broken into three parts. The first part is the policy itself. This is where the who, what, when, where, and why of the policy are talked about. The second part is the procedure, a set of step-by-step instructions to help carry out actions for an expected outcome. The third and last part is the Guide. The guide is where all the resources for the policy live. The references, how-tos, external sources etc can all be included here.

# Procedure

**Procedure**  
A procedure is a **description of the operational processes necessary to implement policy**. A procedure includes information on the offices and positions responsible for policy implementation and instructions to university constituents regarding how to implement the policy, where to turn for information, and the like. A properly developed and approved procedure ensures that policy is implemented efficiently and consistently. Unlike policy, procedures may frequently change to accommodate updated standards or methods. This is one reason it is best practice to separate policy from the procedure; another is to ensure that users can clearly understand what the policy dictates and how to enact it.

Determine the purpose of the SOP

The first step in creating an SOP is to determine why you need it and what you hope to accomplish with it. This will help you focus on the specific processes and procedures that need to be documented.

Gather information

The next step is to gather information about the process or procedure you are documenting. This may involve researching existing documents, consulting with subject matter experts, and observing the process.  
These details would be included in the "Guide" subpage.

Outline the steps

Once you have gathered the necessary information, you can start outlining the actions of the process or procedure. Include clear and concise instructions for each step.  
This list would be included on the "Procedure" subpage.

Review and edit

Once you have completed the draft, it's best to test it.  
Make any necessary edits to ensure that it is accurate, clear, and concise.  
You may want to seek feedback from other team members or subject matter experts to ensure that the PPG is complete and accurate.

Publish and distribute

Once the PPG is finalized, you can publish it and distribute it to the relevant people.

Training

If the PPG is in-depth or technical, it may be best to provide one-on-one training.  
If training is needed, change the PPG to include details that the PPG was missing, aiming to reduce or eliminate necessary training.

Review and update

PPGs should be reviewed and updated regularly to remain accurate and relevant.  
Each PPG, regardless of status, should be reviewed and tested annually.

  

Example Procedure for Example Policy
====================================

This is the to-do list, the action list, and the steps to reproduce the desired outcome.

  

- [ ] Hover over the "\[PPG\] Policy, Procedure, and Guide"
- [ ] Select the three dots on the right-hand side;
- [ ] Select "Duplicate" and wait for the page to load fully.
- [ ] This has now duplicated the "\[PPG\] Policy, Procedure, and Guide," including its subpages and contents. /
- [ ] This is the template that you will use to populate a new PPG;
- [ ] Rename the document keeping \[PPG\], followed by the name of the PPG.
- [ ] Remove the Green banner tooltips, for example, documents.
- [ ] Fill out the content as required.

# Guide

**Guide**  
A guide gives **recommendations, interpretations, administrative instructions, best practice guidance, or frameworks** to operate. Guidelines are informational, not mandatory. Like procedures, guidelines may change frequently depending on the organization’s needs.

  

Example Guide for Example Procedure

Is it a Policy, Procedure, or Guideline?

One of the most important aspects to consider when developing a policy library is determining which content should be included, and which content should not. It is easy to confuse policy with other types of …

# [GUIDE] Time Tracking in ClickUp

_A how-to guide on tracking your time, assigning your time to a task using Time Tracking, and providing additional details._

  

**Opening Time Tracking**
=========================

There are two ways to open Time Tracking.

  

Option 1: Click the square with the four coloured dots on the bottom right corner of the screen. Numerous options will appear; select the "Track Time" option to open Time Tracking. The time tracker will pop up in the bottom right corner of the screen.

  

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/79a0616f-b6b2-40af-89e6-6c1a1fe25483/image.png)

  

Option 2: Using the search bar at the top left corner or by pressing "Ctrl+K," search Time Tracking. Under the results, the "Open Time Tracking" command will pop up. Click it, and the time tracker will pop up in the bottom right corner of the screen.

  

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/631c202f-369f-4293-8b29-5f88df29995e/image.png)![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/367c2482-266a-4f15-8380-084620cf753d/image.png)

  

**Track your time**
===================

Time can be input in 3 ways:

  

1.  Timer: Input the details to accompany your time (tasks, notes, labels, billable. \*see **Customizing your time**\*), then click the play button to begin the timer. Once you begin tracking your time, the native time tracker will follow you wherever you go in ClickUp. Simply click the stop bottom once you are done with your time session.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/1f088b9a-3b24-43df-b4a8-f42aacc296ab/image.png)

  

1.  Manual: Time can be entered manually. (e.g. 2 hours 34 mins).

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/224c4623-b7bd-4834-8810-66e0f28a8b46/image.png)

  

3\. Range: A range in which a task was worked on can also be entered.

Customizing your time
=====================

  

**Assigning your time to a task**
---------------------------------

Using Time Tracking, you can customize which task you want your tracked time to be assigned to.

  

To choose where you would like your tracked time to go, you can:

\-Click the "Select task..." field, which will show a dropdown list of all In Progress tasks.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/7c6aed07-9787-4a8a-9605-e263a374361e/image.png)

\-Enter a Task ID in the "Select task..." field, which can be found by clicking the Task Settings **...** within the task and clicking "Copy ID."

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/80f7ae5b-0748-434c-bd91-7ea1e812bb9e/image.png)

\-You can also create a new task by clicking the "+New task" button.

Time may be tracked without assigning it to a task and then assigned to a task after it has been entered.

  

**Labelling your time**
-----------------------

You can label your time using preset tags or by creating a tag.

  

To do that, click the "Labels" button in the time tracker and search for a preexisting tag or create a new one.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/de8a7a90-3e7d-470b-ba7a-2c57763fbdc3/image.png)

  

### **Billable**

Time can be marked as "billable" or "nonbillable."

  

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/12203d98-bbd1-438a-80b9-69bf9fc4fd89/image.png)

  

### **Notes**

Notes can be used to add details about your time and tasks or to describe how your time was spent.

![](https://t24556004.p.clickup-attachments.com/t24556004/8a15e713-99b9-4cd5-85a3-e7451281a75f/image.png)

Once your time has been recorded, you can manually edit or update your time as needed in the Time Tracking dashboard.

# Adding a Stored Payment Option in Syncro

1.  Go to the customer account of the customer you want to save a payment option.

  

1.  Scroll down to the "STORED PAYMENT PROFILES" section, and click on "New".

  

1.  On the next page, add their credit card information in the designated sections, typically you would be doing this over the phone with the customer.

  

1.  Once done, click on "Store Payment Profile" at the bottom. This will then bring you to another page where you can save the card's information on Syncro. The only thing you need to do here is to make the expiration date a year from when you are adding the card (ex: if you are adding this card in January of 2023, make it expire in January of 2024).

  

1.  Now you can use this card to automatically get charged for recurring invoices, like for our HelpDesk for Home software. To see how to set up recurring invoices in more detail, please see the "How to Make a Recurring Invoice" SoP.

  

1.  If the recurring invoice template is already made, simply go to the template and scroll down until you see the "Payment profile to use" section. Click in the empty box, select the payment option you just added and click on the green "Update Schedule" button to save.
